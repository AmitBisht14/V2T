# V2T Development Workflow Rules

## Development Process

### Before Starting Development
1. Always reference the PRD.md for feature requirements
2. Check existing code structure before adding new components
3. Ensure development environment is properly set up
4. Verify API keys are configured correctly

### Code Development Workflow
1. **Plan**: Break down features into small, testable components
2. **Implement**: Write code following the generation rules
3. **Test**: Create unit tests for new functionality
4. **Document**: Update relevant documentation
5. **Review**: Check code against PRD requirements

### Git Workflow
- Use descriptive commit messages
- Commit frequently with small, focused changes
- Keep main branch stable and working
- Use feature branches for experimental work

## Claude Interaction Guidelines

### When Helping with Code
- Always reference the PRD.md for context
- Follow the technical implementation guidelines in section 11
- Maintain consistency with existing code patterns
- Consider performance and security implications

### Problem-Solving Approach
1. Understand the specific requirement from PRD
2. Check if similar functionality already exists
3. Propose solution that fits the architecture
4. Consider error handling and edge cases
5. Suggest testing approach

### Code Review Checklist
- [ ] Follows Python PEP 8 standards
- [ ] Includes proper error handling
- [ ] Has appropriate type hints
- [ ] Includes docstrings
- [ ] Fits the defined architecture
- [ ] Maintains security best practices
- [ ] Is properly tested

## Project Priorities
1. **Core Functionality**: Audio recording → Transcription → Text cleanup
2. **User Experience**: Simple, responsive interface
3. **Reliability**: Robust error handling and recovery
4. **Performance**: Fast processing and responsive UI
5. **Security**: Safe API key handling and data privacy

## Communication Standards
- Provide clear explanations for technical decisions
- Reference specific PRD sections when relevant
- Suggest improvements that align with project goals
- Ask clarifying questions when requirements are unclear

## Context Engineering Rules
- Always reference PRD.md as the single source of truth
- Follow the technical stack defined in PRD section 11.1
- Maintain the architecture patterns from PRD section 11.2
- Respect the scope limitations defined in PRD section 8
- Prioritize features based on PRD success criteria (section 9)
